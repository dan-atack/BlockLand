// Welcome to the Biomes Library!

// Here is where all the biomes are kept, at the moment in the form of a list of arrays.
// At the bottom we have a biomes object which is the index that holds all of the arrays with the actual biome blueprints.
// This way we can keep the biomes' names while still treating them as though they were in a list (so our randomizer can randomly grab them)
// NOTE: If we ever do jazz up the start screen it should be given a wierd number so it can't be chosen by the randomizer.
