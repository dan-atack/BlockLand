# BLOCKLAND (Working Title):

### This is my first ever game, made from scratch, literally as soon as I learned how to manipulate stuff in the DOM using Vanilla JS.

### It is a side-scrolling adventure game where you play as a little dinosaur, running around a world made up of different types of biomes, following the commands of the mysterious Designer!

## Current Features:

1. NOW PLAYABLE AT https://blockland-63a20.web.app/

2. A homemade physics engine with simple gravity, friction, and collision detection.

3. A loveable little Raptor called Gus (name not currently visible in game, but that's what it is) whose job is to run around, following the mysterious directives of the Designer, whose instructions are visible on the Right-Hand-Side information bar.

4. Gus can gain XP by completing the Designer's objectives, and loses XP if he dies (currently XP is just for score-keeping but will lead to cool powerups in future versions).

5. Terrain scrolls as you move through the world, and you move between different worlds and missions by jumping through mysterious portals.

6. The game is set up to allow easy incorporation of new block types and biomes, so that more interesting environments can be created with relatively little additional coding.

7. Server create-account/login: Initially added a server-side just to prove to myself that I could, but this will be useful down the line for saving a player's stats like XP, inventory status, current level, etc. (Not currently included in Production version)

8. Baddies patrol the map and you must fight your way through them with the claw attack (more diverse attacks coming soon).

9. A final Boss fight atop a precarious tower.

10. 100% homemade visual assets, with thanks to MS Paint, Lunapic.com, and EZGif.com!

## Coming Soon (after some lenthy refactoring):

1. XP lets you buy character upgrades.

2. A cavern level.

3. Hitpoints.

4. Items such as weapons, tools, jetpacks, etc.

5. Hydrodynamics!
