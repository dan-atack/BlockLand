# BLOCKLAND (Working Title):

### This is my first ever game, made from scratch, literally as soon as I learned how to manipulate stuff in the DOM using Vanilla JS.

### It is a side-scrolling adventure game where you play as a little dinosaur, running around a world made up of different types of biomes, following the commands of the mysterious Designer!

## Current Features:

1. NOW PLAYABLE AT https://blockland-63a20.web.app/

2. A homemade physics engine with simple gravity, friction, and collision detection.

3. A loveable little Raptor called Gus (name not currently visible in game, but that's what it is) whose job is to run around, following the mysterious directives of the Designer.

4. Gus can gain XP by completing the Designer's objectives, and loses XP if he dies (currently XP is just for score-keeping but will lead to cool powerups in the near future).

5. Terrain scrolls as you move through the world, and you move between different worlds and missions by jumping through portals.

6. Gus can pick up items to heal damage or enhance his abilities.

7. Server create-account/login: Initially added a server-side just to prove to myself that I could, but this will be useful down the line for saving a player's stats like XP, inventory status, current level, etc. (Not currently included in Production version)

8. Baddies patrol the map and you must fight your way through them with the claw attack (more diverse attacks coming soon).

9. A final Boss fight atop a precarious tower.

10. 100% homemade visual assets, with thanks to MS Paint, Lunapic.com, and EZGif.com!

## Coming Soon(ish):

1. XP lets you buy character upgrades.

2. Advanced items such as weapons, tools, jetpacks, etc.

3. Hydrodynamics!

4. An actual storyline

5. Aesthetics

## Special Thanks

The game's visual assets are entirely homemade, mostly with MS Paint, but a special thanks must go out to EZGif.com and Lunapic.com for their great services to the visual department. An equally big shoutout to SoundJay.com and to Audiotrimmer.com for the game's dynamic sound FX. You guys rock!
