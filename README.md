# BLOCKLAND (Working Title):

### This is my first ever game, made from scratch, literally as soon as I learned how to manipulate stuff in the DOM using Vanilla JS.

### It is a side-scrolling adventure game where you play as a little dinosaur, running around a world made up of different types of biomes, following the commands of the mysterious Designer!

## Current Features:

1. A homemade physics engine with simple gravity, friction, and collision detection for the terrain features.

2. A loveable little Raptor called Gus (name not currently visible in game, but that's what it is) whose job is to run around, following the mysterious directives of the Designer, whose instructions are visible on the Right-Hand-Side information bar.

3. Gus can gain XP by completing the Designer's objectives, and loses XP if he dies (currently this only happens when you fall in a pit of lava, but there will be more ways in future versions).

4. Terrain scrolls until you reach the edge of the world, and in the last level you teleport to a universe made of bacon(!)

5. Animations: Fairly minimal but there are a few keyframes in there to add pizzazz to the adventure.

6. The game is set up to allow easy incorporation of new block types and biomes, so that more interesting environments can be created with only minimal coding.

7. Server create-account/login: Initially added a server-side just to prove to myself that I could, but this will be useful down the line for saving a player's stats like XP, inventory status, current level, etc.

8. Baddies patrol the map, and until a combat system is invented the player has to stay clear if they want to survive!

## Coming Soon:

1. Vertical scrolling - right now you can only move horizontally, but in future versions you'll be able to climb tall mountains and swim to the depths of the sea.

2. More interesting missions! Right now you just run around fairly aimlessly, but as the story develops you will be sent on quests to recover items, kill specific adversaries and so on.

3. HOSTING!!!
